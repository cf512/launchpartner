    "about": "Glass Joe is usually seen as the easiest character to beat in any version of \"Punch-Out!!\" he is in. He has poor defensive skills and takes quite a while to mount any offense. His lone signature maneuver is his \"Taunt Punch\" in which he takes a few steps back, shakes his gloves, and shouts, \"Eh, eh? Vive la France! (Long live France)\" before he rushes forward to unleash his right hook, which can easily be counter-punched for an immediate knockdown."

    "about": "Von Kaiser made his first appearance on the 1987 Nintendo Entertainment System game \"Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!\" as the second opponent in the Minor Circuit. Von Kaiser is generally regarded as harder than Glass Joe, although some may argue that the fact that his OHKD is much quicker and more accessible than Glass Joe's and the fact that he has an infinite makes him easier."

    "about": "Piston Honda (ピストン本田 Pisuton Honda) is a boxer from Tokyo, Japan. His quirks include the fact that Piston Hondo's name and trademark Banzai Rush Attack (also known as the Piston Rush and the Hondo Rush) are reminiscent of Piston Hurricane from the earlier \"Punch-Out!!\" arcade game and later \"Super Punch-Out!!\" Super Nintendo game."

    "about": "In \"Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!\", King Hippo is truly the most unique character of the World Video Boxing Association, as well as the only character who did not have a palette swap. His defense is impenetrable until he opens his mouth. When his mouth is hit, Hippo reveals his one weakness: his overly large trunks start falling down, and he has to keep pulling them up whilst trying to fend off Little Mac's body blows. Once Little Mac floors King Hippo, he does not get up."

Interestingly, despite removing the alcoholic reference from his original identity from the arcade game \"Super Punch-Out!!\", some of his quotes suggest that he still drinks alcohol, rather than soda. He is known for his infamous laugh, which was also used in the Game Over sequence in Zelda II: The Adventure Of Link."

    "about": "In \"Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!\" Super Macho Man became World Circuit Champion. His attacks are the exact same punches as Soda Popinski's. He will usually use his special attack Macho Spin Punch two times in a row, but it doesn't require the player to duck as in all of the other \"Punch-Out!!\" games."

In between rounds, Doc Louis often advises on a weakness or trick in Little Mac's opponent for him to exploit."
