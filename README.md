### Developer's Comments:

Quite a fun assignment. My coding bootcamp program moved at a super fast pace, so it was nice spending time getting more familiar with different aspects of ReactJS and MERN.

Some of my favorite parts included:

* adding form validation steps for the required Name field as well as the "includes" method for validating that URLs were valid for the Image URL field by containing an http/https prefix
* figuring out that ternary operators would be perfect for adding a placeholder image automatically when no Image URL is submitted, so that there are no broken image icons in the list of characters
* creating a live preview section for form submissions and tying the same placeholder images into that
* taking a trip down memory lane by choosing to do Punch-Out as the theme, which is one of my childhood favorite NES video games
